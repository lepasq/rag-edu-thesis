Martin\\'s fantasy novel series \\'\\'A Song of Ice and Fire\\'\\' and its television adaptation \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\'. It is spoken by the Dothraki, a nomadic people in the series\\'s fictional world. The language was developed for the TV series by the linguist David J. Peterson, working off the Dothraki words and phrases in Martin\\'s novels.\\n\\n, the language comprised 3163 words, not all of which have been made public. In 2012, 146 newborn girls in the United States were named \"Khaleesi\", the Dothraki term for the wife of a \\'\\'khal\\'\\' or ruler, and the title adopted in the series by Daenerys Targaryen. Dothraki and Valyrian have been described as \"the most convincing fictional tongues since Elvish\".\\n\\n==Development==\\nDavid J. Peterson, creator of the Dothraki spoken language for \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\'\\n\\nThe Dothraki vocabulary was created by David J. Peterson well in advance of the adaptation. HBO hired the Language Creation Society to create the language, and after an application process involving over 30 conlangers, Peterson was chosen to develop the Dothraki language. He delivered over 1700 words to HBO before the initial shooting.

Martin’s description of the language, as well as from such languages as Estonian, Inuktitut, Turkish, Russian, and Swahili.\\n\\nDavid J. Peterson and his development of the Dothraki language were featured on an April 8, 2012 episode of CNN\\'s \\'\\'The Next List\\'\\'. He went on to create the Valyrian languages for season 3 of \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\'.  Peterson and his development of Dothraki were also featured on the January 8, 2017 episode of \\'\\'To Tell the Truth\\'\\'.\\n\\n===Language constraints===\\nThe Dothraki language was developed under two significant constraints.  First, the language had to match the uses already put down in the books. Secondly, it had to be easily pronounceable or learnable by the actors. These two constraints influenced the grammar and phonology of the language: for instance, as in English, there is no contrast between aspirated and unaspirated stops.\\n\\n==Phonology and romanization==\\nDavid Peterson has said, \"You know, most people probably don\\'t really know what Arabic actually sounds like, so to an untrained ear, it might sound like Arabic.

If there were to be any written examples of Dothraki in the \\'\\'A Song of Ice and Fire\\'\\' universe, it would be in a writing system developed in the Free Cities and adapted to Dothraki, or in some place like Ghis or Qarth, which do have writing systems.\\n\\n=== Consonants ===\\nThere are 23 consonant phonemes in the Dothraki language.

Prefixes, suffixes and circumfixes are all used. Verbs conjugate in infinitive, past, present, future, two imperatives and (archaic) participle; they also agree with person, number and polarity. Nouns divide into two classes, inanimate and animate. They decline in five cases, nominative, accusative, genitive, allative and ablative. Animate nouns also decline according to number.\\n\\n===Word order===\\nThe basic word order is SVO (subject–verb–object). In a basic sentence, the order of these elements (when all three are present) is as in English: first comes the subject (S), followed by the verb (V), and then the object (O).\\n:'''Khal ahhas arakh.'''''The Khal (S) sharpened (V) the arakh (O).''\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 4}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '9fc8158c8988ba70763d82649f07fcea'}>,\n",

The order is as follows: demonstrative, noun, adverb, adjective, genitive noun, prepositional phrase.

Modal particles precede the verb.\\n\\nIn the episode \"Andy\\'s Ancestry\" from the United States television show \\'\\'The Office\\'\\', Dwight Schrute created the Dothraki phrase \"throat rip\" by placing \"throat\" in front to make it the accusative.
